Prompt: Now adjust the randomly seeded initial locations so that the center of mass of the three body system is located at the origin.

Gemini: I'd be happy to adjust the simulation to ensure the center of mass (COM) of the three-body system is always initialized at the origin $(0, 0)$. This ensures a stable, non-drifting system view, as the COM of an isolated N-body system always moves at a constant velocity (which is zero here, since the initial velocities are zero).I have updated the initialization logic in the Canvas document, "three_body_simulator.py". The script now:Generates three random positions (temp_pos1, temp_pos2, temp_pos3).Checks the "interesting configuration" heuristics (separation and non-collinearity).If heuristics pass, it calculates the COM of the temporary configuration.It shifts all three positions by subtracting the COM vector, thereby centering the system at the origin.It verifies that the new, centered positions still fall within the fixed AXIS_LIMIT.It repeats this process until a valid, centered, and interesting configuration is found.
