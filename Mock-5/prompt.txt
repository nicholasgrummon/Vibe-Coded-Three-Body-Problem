Prompt: Simulation works but bodies do not appear to interact after the first frame. The bodies set off in the appropriate direction and then do not alter course for the remainder of the simulation. This should not be the case.

Gemini: This behavior—where the bodies initially move but then follow straight, unaltered paths—is a classic symptom of numerical instability in gravitational simulations.In the original code, when two bodies pass very close to each other (which is inevitable in a chaotic 3-body system), the distance ($r$) approaches zero. Since the force is proportional to $1/r^2$, the calculated force magnitude becomes astronomically large, leading to numerical overflow. This "catastrophic force" flings the bodies out to a vast distance in a single time step, where the gravitational force then truly does become negligible, causing them to coast in straight lines (free-fall) forever after.To fix this, I have introduced a softening factor (SOFTENING_EPSILON). This small constant is added to the denominator of the force calculation, preventing the force from ever becoming infinite, thus stabilizing the simulation and allowing for continuous, chaotic interaction.I have updated the three_body_simulator.py file with the new parameter and the corrected force calculation.
