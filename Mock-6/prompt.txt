Prompt: Please fix the output window to have a set domain and range

Gemini: I understand you want to change the output window of the simulation plot from a dynamically resizing view to a fixed domain and range. This is often necessary when the bodies fly far away but you only want to focus on the chaotic motion near the center.
I have updated the Canvas document, "three_body_simulator.py", by introducing a global parameter AXIS_LIMIT to set the fixed range and by commenting out the dynamic axis adjustment logic in the update_plot function.

Prompt: This did not fix the axes.

Gemini: I appreciate you pointing out that the axes were still problematic. While the code did technically set the fixed limits, sometimes Matplotlib needs an explicit instruction to prevent autoscaling.I have updated the Canvas document, "three_body_simulator.py", to:Explicitly set ax.autoscale(False) after defining the limits to ensure they remain fixed throughout the animation.Increased AXIS_LIMIT from $5.0$ to $7.5$ to give the unstable system more room to evolve near the center before bodies fly off screen and are clipped.This should guarantee that the plot window remains centered and fixed at the [-AXIS_LIMIT, AXIS_LIMIT] domain and range.
