Prompt:
"Code a python project/script that makes use of matplotlib or another graphics library to visualize the "three-body problem", a popular physics application in which there are three masses in mutual orbit with no stable solution. A user of this code should be able to specify parameters including mass of each object, strength of gravity, speed of simulation, etc as global variables. The simulation should include an iterative plot of the locations of each of the three bodies through a series of points through time, as well as a time-history of the body locations represented as a thin line/path where the bodies have previously traversed. Make use of a Python class structure or other file structure at your convenience. Assume the bodies begin at rest."

"I'd be happy to code a Python simulation for the gravitational three-body problem.This script uses matplotlib for visualization, numpy for vector physics calculations, and a class structure to manage the state and dynamics of the bodies. The initial conditions are set such that the three bodies begin at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with zero initial velocity, which quickly leads to the expected chaotic and unstable motion.I've defined the key parameters like masses and the gravitational constant ($G$) as global constants at the top of the file, so you can easily adjust the simulation's initial conditions and speed.
Here are the files: <three_body_simulator.py>
This script defines the Body and ThreeBodySimulator classes to handle the physics. It then uses matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation to run the simulation steps and continuously update the plot, showing both the current position of the three masses (as large markers) and their entire historical path (as thin lines).To run this, make sure you have numpy and matplotlib installed (pip install numpy matplotlib). You can easily tweak the initial values for M1, M2, M3, G, and DT at the top of the file to explore different scenarios!"
