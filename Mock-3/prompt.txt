Prompt: "Getting error: ValueError: ['r', 'g', 'b'] is not a valid value for color: supported inputs are (r, g, b) and (r, g, b, a) 0-1 float tuples; '#rrggbb', '#rrggbbaa', '#rgb', '#rgba' strings; named color strings; string reprs of 0-1 floats for grayscale values; 'C0', 'C1', ... strings for colors of the color cycle; and pairs combining one of the above with an alpha value"

Gemini: "I acknowledge your request to fix the ValueError related to color application in the Canvas document, "Three-Body Problem Simulator," by updating the code to use separate marker objects for each body.
The error arises because body_points was created as a single line object, which cannot accept a list of colors when using set_color(). The fix is to define three separate marker objects, one for each body, and update their positions individually."
